# Game Design Document (GDD) Template

**Purpose:**
This repository contains a comprehensive Game Design Document (GDD) template designed to help game developers organize and document their game development process. It is structured to cover all essential aspects of game design, including gameplay mechanics, art direction, sound design, technical specifications, monetization, and more.

**Why Obsidian?**
This template is optimized for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful markdown-based note-taking tool. Obsidian’s linking and folder structure make it an ideal tool for organizing and navigating complex documents like a GDD. Each section of the GDD is broken into individual markdown files for easy management and customization.

## Features:

- **Organized Structure:** All aspects of game development are broken down into clear, manageable sections.
- **Markdown-Based:** Easy to edit, track, and collaborate on, with support for Obsidian’s linking and navigation.
- **Flexible:** Adapt the template to suit your project’s specific needs, whether you’re working solo or with a team.
